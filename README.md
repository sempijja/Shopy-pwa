## **PWA Features**

Shopy is designed as a PWA, meaning it:

- Can be installed directly from the browser to the home screen or desktop.
- Works offline by caching assets and critical data via service workers.
- Automatically updates content in the background.

### **Testing the PWA**

1. **Install the App**:
   - Open the app in Chrome or any PWA-compatible browser.
   - Click the `Install` button (usually in the browser menu or address bar).

2. **Simulate Offline Mode**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
   - Go to the `Application` tab.
   - Select `Service Workers` and check the `Offline` option.
   - Refresh the page to test offline functionality.
